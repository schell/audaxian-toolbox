# audaxian-toolbox

![status](https://gitlab.com/schell/audaxian-toolbox/badges/master/build.svg)

This is a collection of Haskell monads, patterns and utilities for building web
applications. [Phiddipus audax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phidippus_audax)
is a really cool spider I found in my back yard. Like an agile spider, this
package jumps around a lot.

## includes

* MTL style key value store with implementations:
  [x] S3
  [ ] DynamoDB

> Like the `Void`, when you stare into the audax - the audax stares into you.
